<h5>Description.</h5>
                <p>A workforce scheduling web application rooted from my past personnel management experience. This app currently allows users to create employees, create positions, and schedule shifts for employees. Other features have been added and the app will continue to grow as more features are developed. The ScheduleQuik app was created using React.js and C# on the .NET framework.</p>

                <p>A scripting or programming language that allows you to implement
                    complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more
                    than just sit there and display static information for you to
                    look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
                    animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you
                    can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
